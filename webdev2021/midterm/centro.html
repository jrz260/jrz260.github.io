			<div id="text_arbol">The tree of life is a clay sculpture commonly made by hand in Metepec Mexico. The images depicted in the sculptures were originally used, during the early colonial period, to teach the history of creation, according to the Bible, to the natives of the region. The making of tree-shaped clay sculptures began in Izúcar de Matamoros, Puebla, but today their manufacture is more closely identified with Metepec. Tradition dictates that they must represent certain biblical passages, such as the story of Adam and Eve, but currently trees are created with themes completely unrelated to the Bible. The more traditional tree of life contains a number of important images. In the upper part of the sculpture an image of God is placed; below, the branches of the tree are related to the creation of the world in seven days. Other characteristic images are the sun and the moon, animals, flowers and fruits that symbolize paradise.</div>

			<div id="text_huichol">The Huichol people (also known as Wixarika) are a clear example of Mexican culture and are recognized throughout Mexico for their culture and art. Huichol artisans base their beliefs on their roots, which are based on the four elements of creation: earth, water, air and fire, all this dates back to ancient times, where shamans or priests created figures as representations of their deities and sacred animals. The Huicholes carve figures of deities and sacred animals in wood that they adorn with bead mosaic, the masks are adorned with both yarn and beads. The gourds are water containers that are always adorned with beads and, by the way, only inside. For them the bead is a symbol of water. There are an infinity of figures that are carved and all of them carry symbols of their culture, thus generating pieces of art with extraordinary value due to the meaning, ingenuity and time spent in their elaboration.</div>

			<div id="text_plata"> History says that one of the first presents that Hernán Cortés received from Moctezuma was a pair of discs made out of gold and silver, with the images of the sun and the moon engraved on each. Since prehispanic times, the habitants of the Michoacán, Oaxaca and Guerrero regions have dominated the technique of giving life to these precious metals into jewelry and objects that- to this date are a symbol of wealth and power. Today, one of the best places where one can acquire silver in Mexico is Taxco in the state of Guerrero. In this town, you can find many studios and galleries where you can see some of the best silver works in the world, including jewelry, kitchenware and home decor items. Currently, there are many modern jewlers that have adaped these ancient techniques and produce beautiful pieces.</div>

			<div id="text_talavera"> In 1550, artisans from Spain settled in Puebla; where they shared their techniques and incorporated the handling of the clay that was known to the indigenous people. They sought to produce richer pottery than what was created in Europe. The result was what today is known as Talavera Poblana. The process of making talavera lasts several days and goes through different stages. The paint with which the talaveras are decorated are made of natural minerals. The yellow color from antimony, the green is extracted from copper, orange is found in amantite, iron oxide produces a black color, and blue is made from cobalt oxide, the most important and characteristic of the talaveras. Sometimes, cobalt oxide has to be imported from Africa or Germany, causing the pieces painted in blue to increase in price.</div>
