			<div id="text_textileschiapas">The textile crafts produced in Oaxaca have a wide diversity of styles due to the fact that it has the greatest ethnic wealth in the country. Although the works are made of the same materials (cotton, wool and silk), they are very different in iconography and design. In most communities, textiles are made on a backstrap loom and in some of them the winch is still used for spinning, as well as natural dyes such as cochineal, indigo and purple snail to dye the fabrics. In general, the textiles of this region are beautifully decorated with embroidery that include various motifs, some of clear pre-Hispanic origin, nature and animals.</div>

			<div id="text_barronegro"> Admired worldwide, Oaxacan black clay is manufactured in San Bartolo Coyotepec, through ancestral techniques that are the key to its ornamental excellence. Extracted from lonely places on the outskirts of the town, the black clay is manipulated to be burned, using molds and lathes. Subsequently, it is left to dry in the sun for four days. The pieces are then carefully polished and details such as openwork are added. Again it is left to dry in the sun for another four days. It is then when the pieces are ready for the baking process and in this same phase of the elaboration, they acquire their particular dark metallic tone. These ornamental vases are beautiful and full of history.</div>

			<div id="text_alebrije">The alebrije is a Mexican handicraft traditionally made with a cardboard technique. It is a fantastic figure that combines physiognomic elements of various animals, whether real or imaginary, and is characterized by being painted in vibrant colors. Today, alebrijes are an undeniable part of the cultural and artistic imaginary of Mexico, and it is a craft in constant evolution. Since 2007, the Museum of Popular Art of Mexico City has organized a parade the intention of promoting Mexican folk arts and culture. In it, hundreds of artisans build alebrijes up to four meters high and walk them through the historic center of the city in an event full of dance, music and color.</div>
