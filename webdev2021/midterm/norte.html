			<div id="text_ceramicachihuahua">The ceramics that are made in "Mata Ortiz", a small town near Paquimé in Chihuahua, seem to have come from the mind of a great artist. Its Greek lines and symbols have a tradition of more than 1,300 years. The smooth texture is due to the mixture of different clays; the red and black colors that are distinguished from the light background, give it an ancestral touch of good taste. As for the symbols, there is simply no equal design, these are as varied as in the minds of the masters. These designs are geometric compositions either of pre-Hispanic influence or typical of artisans with an extraordinary pulse: different lines and shapes all mixed with animals, plants, birds, fish, men and emblems of nature.</div>

			<div id="text_sombrero">In the north of the country, the most popular style of hat is the northern, western or Texan type, and which has been distinguished by being used in northern Mexico and the southern United States. This hat is made of filter, wool, rabbit fur, or beaver or chinchilla hair. There are also different styles, such as closed, duranguense or square. It is a style that has been popularized by films as a “cowboy hat” but it originated in the northern area of Mexico. It is commonly used by people who spend long days under the sun or work in fields, however, many designers have taken their contemporary twists on these styles and are being produced as a modern accessory.</div>

			<div id="text_sarape">The serape is a typical garment recognized worldwide for its colorful designs. It was used by charros, chinacos and silvers during the early twentieth century and became a symbol of the Mexican people. The weaving technique, the spinning processes and the dyeing are not just anything. The process requires a lot of skill and creativity from the artisans, who with natural materials and their hands, achieve unique designs of incredible beauty. The serape is so iconic that the National Museum of Anthropology and History houses a large collection. Not only do they have contemporary sarapes, some date back centuries! And all, with the purpose of studying the technique and iconography present in each one of them.</div>
